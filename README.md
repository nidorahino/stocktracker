This is the code for the StockTracker project. This program is a simple webscraper that can help a user analyze multiple stocks at once by 
inputting just the stock tickers. The program will ask the user for the number of stocks to retrieve information about and the tickers for 
those stocks. The program will then return several key statistics about each of those stocks printed to console and files named after the 
stock tickers.
